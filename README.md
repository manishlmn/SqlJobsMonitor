# SqlJobsMonitorExcel

Created simple excel application for monitoring all jobs which are running in sql agent window. This application gives easy access to view list of present running jobs, last ran jobs, schedules of all jobs in one shot.
This gives easy to change the server and track the list of output.

This will be use full when you are dealing with multiple environments and running multiple jobs.To track them very difficult task and time consuming task , to connect each server and open sql job monitor it will hectic process to do that.

So decide to create a small application which gives more clarity and speedy response.

i used just Vb scripts and macros, excel sheet.
